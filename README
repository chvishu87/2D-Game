Description:
	1. The animation has a background and some multiframe sprites that keep moving.
	2. The SDL_Surface and Frames classes are implemented as flyweight pattern and they have factory classes.
	3. The Sprite class has a spriteManager that is used by the manager class. The sprite manager provides the manager with the sprites it askes for.
	4. The FrameFacotry is used by spriteManager in the creation of the sprites and the SurfaceFactory is used by the FrameFactory in creating the frames.

To change the XML file and the animation:
	1. The number of characters in the animation can be changed by changing the <spriteCount> tag in xmlSpec/game.xml
	2. The length of the world can be changed by changing the <worldWidth> tag in xmlSpec/game.xml

The Specs that I implemented are:
	1. The multiframe sprites can be tracked. The sprite being tracked can be changed be pressing 't'.
	2. The animation can be paused by pressing 'p' and is resumed by pressing 'p' again.
	3. The animation has a help feature that illustrated all the options available for the animation. It can be seen by pressing the 'F1' key and can be closed by pressing the 'F1' key again.

The Specs that I was unable to implement are:
	1. The L system is not implemented.

Extras:
	1. No errors or warnings during the execution.
